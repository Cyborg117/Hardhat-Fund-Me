# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn hardhat test
yarn hardhat deploy
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/fund.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/withdraw.js
```
